# Self Introduction

Hello, my name is Maryam Judeh. I'm currently working towards an associate's in Computer Science: Java degree at WCC. Afterward, I plan to transfer to EMU to pursue a bachelor's in computer science. I've mostly learned Java so far, but also a little Python and C++. I'm excited to work on this project and hope to learn and grow from this experience!
