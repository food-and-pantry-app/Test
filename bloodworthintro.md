My name is Sarah Bloodworth. I am in my final semester at Washtenaw Community College. I'm currently pursuing an
associate's degree in Java programming. I had previously attended WCC back in 2010, but was unable to finish my
degree at the time. I'm happy to be back, although it has been tough. School is much harder than I remember it
being! However, it has been worth the change.

I am currently a barista at the coffee shop up the road from my home, but I am hanging up my apron at the end of
January due to moving into my boyfriend's childhood home. We are very excited to take it over and start creating
our own little space. After moving, I'll be focusing on furthering my education by getting a bachelors degree and
starting the internship hunt.

Ideally, I will end up working as a developer on a project that is some type of crafting aid. I really enjoy
all types of crafting, so I think that I will have a great time working on creating companion apps to make
crafting more intriguing to others.

Outside of school and work, I like to go camping, hiking and kayaking (really anything outdoors-y that doesn't
require a lot of athleticism...). When the weather isn't as ideal, I spend my time indoors knitting, crocheting,
or playing video games. I have one cat, Castiel, that likes to 'help' me with my yarn crafts and snuggle up on the
couch. It's a quiet little life, but it's all that I need.
